# Vertebral Column Classification with Unsupervised and Supervised Learning

This project explores the classification of vertebral column conditions using a combination of unsupervised clustering (K-Means, Agglomerative, GMM) and supervised learning (KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Bayesian). The dataset contains biomechanical features and class labels indicating whether a patient’s spine is normal or abnormal. 

## Files
- `data.txt` – Main dataset with biomechanical attributes
- `EDA_Dataprep.ipynb` – Python notebook with EDA and data preprocessing
- `Unsupervised.ipynb` – Python notebook for unsupervised methods
- `Supervised.ipynb` – Python notebook for supervised methods
- `DATA70132_report.pdf` – Final project report including methodology, visualizations, and results

## Results
- High classification accuracy achieved using supervised methods
- Unsupervised clustering showed partial separability, supporting the presence of structure in the data
- Evaluation demonstrated the importance of combining domain knowledge with robust machine learning techniques
